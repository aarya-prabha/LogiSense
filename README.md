# 🚚 LogiSense — Delivery Intelligence & Route Optimization System

> A Machine Learning-powered logistics platform that predicts delivery delays and recommends optimal delivery routes with actionable insights.

---

## 📌 Overview

**LogiSense** is an end-to-end logistics optimization system designed to solve one of the biggest challenges in modern supply chains — **delivery delays**.

It combines:

- 📊 **Machine Learning (Delay Prediction)**
- 🧭 **Route Optimization Engine**
- 📈 **Interactive Analytics Dashboard**

The system predicts delivery risks **before dispatch**, recommends the **best vehicle & route**, and provides **data-driven insights** for logistics operators.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Delivery delays lead to:

- Increased operational costs
- Customer dissatisfaction
- Failed deliveries & reattempts
- Revenue loss

Traditional systems are reactive — **LogiSense is predictive and proactive.**

---

## 💡 Solution

LogiSense provides **three core capabilities**:

### 🔴 1. Delay Prediction

- Uses **Random Forest Classifier**
- Predicts probability of delay **before dispatch**
- Based on: Weather, Distance, Package type & weight, Vehicle type, Delivery mode

### 🟢 2. Route Optimization Engine

- Physics + business-rule based scoring system
- Suggests **optimal vehicle & route**
- Considers: Weather risk, SLA feasibility, Cost efficiency, Package compatibility

### 🔵 3. Analytics Dashboard

- Built using **Plotly + Streamlit**
- Provides insights on: Delay vs Weather, Delay vs Vehicle, Regional performance, Partner efficiency

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

### Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

**Why Random Forest?**
- Handles mixed data types
- Robust to outliers
- No feature scaling required
- Provides feature importance

### ⚙️ Hyperparameters

| Parameter | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| `n_estimators` | 200 |
| `max_depth` | 12 |
| `min_samples_leaf` | 5 |
| `class_weight` | balanced |

---

## 🧪 Model Performance

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| **Accuracy** | 88.5% |
| **ROC-AUC** | 0.964 |
| **Recall (Delayed)** | 95.7% |
| **Precision** | 71.1% |

> ✅ High recall ensures we catch almost all real delays before they happen.

## 🧩 Feature Engineering

### Derived Features

| Feature | Formula |
|---------|---------|
| `time_ratio` | `actual_time / expected_time` |
| `cost_per_km` | `delivery_cost / distance_km` |
| `weight_distance` | `weight × distance` |

- Label Encoding for categorical variables
- 12 total features used for training
